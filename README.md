# USA-Real-Estate-Market-Analysis
Uncovering insights from 2.2 M+ listings across states

Hi, I’m Abu Sufian, and in this project, I dove deep into the 2024 U.S. real estate market to uncover hidden patterns, regional pricing dynamics, and what really drives home values in different parts of the country.  

If you're a **homebuyer**, **investor**, or simply a **data enthusiast**—this analysis will give you a clearer picture of where value lies, which cities are booming, and how you can make more informed property decisions using data.

## Why I Did This Project

I’ve always been fascinated by real estate trends—how the same house can cost $200K in one city and $2M in another. So I asked myself:  
**What makes one home more valuable than another?**  
Is it the size? The number of beds? The location? Or something else?

To find the answers, I used Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to clean, explore, and visualize thousands of property listings across the U.S.

## What You'll Learn from This Project

- Which states and cities are the most (and least) expensive to buy a home  
- Whether **bedrooms** or **bathrooms** affect pricing more (spoiler: it’s not what most people think!)  
- Which ZIP codes offer surprising value—and which are overpriced  
- How to measure home value using new engineered features like **price per sqft**, **acre per bedroom**, and more

## Key Analyses (with Real Insights)

Here are the major analyses I performed and the stories the data told me:

### 🗺 1. Average Property Price by State  
Hawaii leads with an average price of ~$1.4M—no surprise given its paradise appeal. But the Virgin Islands, California, and New York aren’t far behind.

### 🏙️ 2. Top 10 Cities with Highest Median Prices  
Cities like **Rancho Santa Fe** ($4.97M) and **Malibu** ($3.97M) top the charts. These aren’t just cities—they’re luxury destinations.  
➡️ *Bar chart showing city-wise price distribution*

### 📐 3. Home Size Distribution  
Most homes fall between 1,000–3,000 sqft, which seems to be the sweet spot for American living.  
➡️ *Histogram + boxplot*

### 🛏️ 4. Beds vs. Price  
Yes, more bedrooms mean more price—but not always. The relationship is not perfectly linear.  
➡️ *Boxplot*

### 🛁 5. Bathrooms vs. Price — The Real Influencer  
Here’s something interesting: **bathrooms affect price more than bedrooms.**  
Even with the same number of beds, homes with more baths are consistently more expensive.  
💡 *If you’re renovating, consider adding a bathroom over a bedroom!*

### 🌾 6. Acre Lot Size vs. Price  
Larger lots = higher price? Not always. This varies drastically by state.  
➡️ *Scatter plot to visualize spread*

### 🔥 7. Correlation Heatmap  
Strongest price correlations?  
- `house_size` → 0.62  
- `bath` → 0.54  
➡️ Bedrooms? Much less important than I thought.

### 📍 8. Most Common ZIP Codes  
By finding ZIPs with the most listings, I could identify real estate hot zones.  
➡️ *Donut chart showing listing density*

### 🏷️ 9. State-wise Price Category Breakdown  
I divided listings into three tiers: **affordable**, **mid-range**, and **luxury**.  
California unsurprisingly leads in luxury homes, but states like Florida and Texas offer tons of affordable properties.  
➡️ *Stacked bar chart*

### 📦 10. Price Distribution by State  
California has a massive price range—million-dollar homes next to mid-range ones.  
➡️ *Boxplot showing price variation*

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering: Making Raw Data Smarter

Sometimes raw data isn’t enough. I created new features to get deeper insights:

- **Price per Sqft** – A better way to compare value across cities  
- **Is_Luxury_Home** – A binary tag for homes priced above $1M  
- **Bedroom/Bathroom Ratio** – Tells us how balanced a home layout is  
- **Acre per Bedroom** – Helps evaluate land usage efficiency
